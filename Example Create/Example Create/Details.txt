This project is created to aid solving the Prime and Fibonacci Assignment.

The goal of this assignment is to create two seperate files.
The first file is part 1. 
## PART 1 
#Primes
You are to find/generate the first X number of primes whose value
is less than 4,000,000 (Four Million). This should conform to to 
the Pi function π(x). You can locate the function itself and refrence
to this function via Google. But a working rescource is :
https://primes.utm.edu/nthprime/index.php

Generate all the primes and print them to a file, along with a numerical
count. i.e. 
1. 2
2. 3
3. 5

You are not required to prove that 2,3,and 5 are prime. These are given
you must show/generate from these the rest of the primes.

##PART 2
#Fibonacci Sequence

You are embarking on a new systematic approach to the generation of
a well known, and natrually occuring sequence. 

You have to not only generate the sequence from the previous two terms. 

Given the equation : 

Fibonacci (n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2);
You are given three terms of the sequence.
Fibonacci (0) = 0;
Fibonacci (1) = 1;
Fibonacci (2) = 1;

Simple adherence to the golden ratio we know that the 
ratio of sequential elements of the Fibonacci sequence approach
the golden ratio asymptotically. 

#Golden Ratio Phi ( ф  or  Ф )
 Phi = (1 + √(5)) / 2 

 However this will be useful, but the Fibonacci sequence you generate
 needs to be exact.  i.e. the terms at 300 must match the terms 
 at 300 on lists online :

 There are others. 
 
 This part of the project ends when you have found the first 100 digit 
 term of the fibonacci sequence, you must print out to a file, all terms from 
 f(0) to f(X) where f(X) = the first 100 digit fibonacci number.

 ## CULMINATION

 #CHRONO

 Last but not least time the project.
 You are to use some form of chrono to time the total time 
 of the project, from generation to print.

 You will encounter this. 
 When timing the project with use of the Debugger, i.e. when you 
 use the IDE Visual Studio's to compile the project, and not use
 the *.exe either created in the Debug Folder, or the Release 
 dependent on how you chose to build the project. You will have 
 a time dependency on the IDE which will not count against you in 
 the end of the project. 

 Use the *.exe to show the total time.
